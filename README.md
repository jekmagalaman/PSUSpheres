## Brief Description of the project

We have created a virtual environment and connected it to a GitHub repository. This project is a college management system built with Django Admin. We create 8 Colleges, 10 programs, 2 orgs, and 2 org members. We've optimized the Django Admin interface for easy CRUD operations. Using superuser account, it gives us full control in our activity to finish it smoothly. Lastly, we also used faker, to easly fill the tables with sample data.
